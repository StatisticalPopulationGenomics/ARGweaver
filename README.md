# Chapter 11: ARGweaver

The scripts in this directory document the analysis discussed in the
ARGweaver chapter. They are provided to give a concrete example of
how ARGweaver can be used.

These scripts are intended as a tutorial; they are not intended to be
run directly. Depending on the data sets being used, various steps
will need to be adjusted as discussed in the chapter (such as setting
mutation and recombination rates, population sizes, and mask files).
Many of the steps prior to running ARGweaver can be done in a different
order, or need to be done only a single time for a paricular genome-wide
data set.

See the top of runArgWeaver.sh for more information on system requirements.

The ARGweaver code can be downloaded installed from:
